Besides from being a student musicology im also a musician myself. Studying Musicology is a way for me to spread my chances to find a job in this industry.
However i enjoy playing music more then studying it and have decided to cheat the system where possible.
My music of choice is Metal since i have always listend to and played this genre. The downside is that there are a lot of subgenres within Metal. Each having their own specifics and characteristics. Being a Student i am very short on time so i wont have time to be able to specialise myself in these things.
So now i have to figure out where the money is within this genre. 
For this i need to compare different subgenres and figure out what the global trend is within them and how they are linked to populairy. Using these findings i should be able to get a carreer going in no time. 
I will use the following subgenres to analyse; thrash, stoner, doom, heavy and progressive metal. 
For all the subgenres i will analyse playlists to find commen trends within the subgenre , then i will look which of these can be linked with popularity within this genre.
