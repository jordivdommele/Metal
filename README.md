what makes metal commercial? 
metal is known to have many subgenres each known for specific features. 
For example, thrash metal is know for fast playing and high energy. 
Other subgenres of metal might rely on lower tuned instruments or complexity. 
I will try to take a look into different genres of metal and compare their most outstanding variables. 
I will do so by taking commerical artists that represent their genre and cover their best sold albums , still within the context of their representet genre and take the mean variables from them. 
When all my variables are collected i will compare them and see if there is an overall variable that is common in commercial metal.
I will devide the following subgenres : Thrash, Heavy, Folk , Doom , Death, Power and progressive. 
For Thrashmetal i will take the following artists; Metallica, Megadeht, Slayer and Exodus. 
For the following artists i will use get_artist_audio feature , then proceed to filter on bpm. From those songs i will filter songs that are withing the subgenre and compare their engery and bpm. 
For all the bands the top bpm seems around 200 and energy levels around 0.95 
megadeths top bpm levels are from live performances of a song that is not fast at all , spotify seems to pick this up as double time.
